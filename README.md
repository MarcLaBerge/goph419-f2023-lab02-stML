Lab 2
Marc Laberge


The purpose of this lab is to examine algorithms for solving linear systems of 
equations and using spline interpolation between discrete data points. You will also 
explore the use of functional and object-oriented programming in Python by writing 
functions that return functions and comparing your results with objects generated by a 
class for univariate interpolation in SciPy
